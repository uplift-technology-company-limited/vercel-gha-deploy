# Uplift Tech — Claude Code plugins

A [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin marketplace
published by Uplift Tech. One repo, multiple plugins — each documents a real
piece of Uplift's engineering convention as a reusable Claude Code skill.

## Plugins

### `vercel-gha-deploy`

Teaches Claude to set up **Vercel deploys via GitHub Actions** — with a
`main`-only branch gate and **auto-bumped `vX.Y.Z` version tags** baked into the
build and shown in your UI. Can also **bootstrap** a fresh repo (git init →
GitHub → `vercel link`) that isn't wired up yet.

When you ask Claude to "set up Vercel deploy", "add a GitHub Actions deploy for
my Next.js app", "wire auto-versioning onto my Vercel deploys", or similar, it
guides Claude through:

- **Bootstrap** (if needed): git init, `.gitignore`, secret-scan, create the
  GitHub repo, `vercel link`.
- **`scripts/deploy.sh`**: `compute_version` (bump the highest `vX.Y.Z` tag) →
  `vercel pull/build/deploy --prebuilt --prod` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`
  baked in → push the tag **only after a successful deploy**.
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**: typecheck gate → deploy → smoke test, with
  a `main`-only guard and a `workflow_dispatch` bump input (arm `push: main`
  after the first green run).
- **Version display**: wire `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` into `next.config` and show
  `v{version}` in the footer.
- **Secrets**: `VERCEL_TOKEN` as a GitHub **org secret** (all repos inherit it) +
  per-repo `VERCEL_ORG_ID` / `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`.

It deliberately runs the deploy from **GitHub Actions** (not Vercel's native git
integration) so you can gate on checks, bake a build-time version, and cut a git
tag per release. Supports both GitHub-hosted and **self-hosted** runners.

**Not for**: fixing app/code bugs that surface in a build, one-off manual
`vercel --prod` runs, Vercel dashboard settings, Vercel's native git
integration, or deploys to other targets (AWS ECS, Docker, a VPS).

```
/plugin install vercel-gha-deploy@uplift-plugins
```

Templates: [`plugins/vercel-gha-deploy/skills/vercel-gha-deploy/assets/`](plugins/vercel-gha-deploy/skills/vercel-gha-deploy/assets)
(`deploy.sh`, `deploy.yml` — fill in `<PROJECT_NAME>`, `<PROD_DOMAIN>`, runner label).

### `upliftcontrolversion`

Uplift's own playbook for wiring a repo so **every deploy auto-bumps a git tag
(`vX.Y.Z`)**, the number is baked into the artifact, shown to humans (a UI label
or a `/version` API), and kept in sync with telemetry (`OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION`) —
instead of drifting off a hand-edited, easily-stale `"1.0.0"`.

Covers two shapes with concrete, copy-paste guidance for each:

- **Frontend** (Next.js in Docker) — inject via a Docker build-arg, display as a
  UI label.
- **Backend** (a runtime service) — inject via a task-def env var, expose via
  `GET /version` and `/health`.

Ask Claude to "add version tags that bump automatically on every deploy", "show
the running version in the UI", "add a `/version` endpoint", or "stop
`OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION` from drifting" and it walks through both the shared
tag-bump mechanics and the shape-specific wiring.

```
/plugin install upliftcontrolversion@uplift-plugins
```

### `upliftgha`

Sets up, migrates, or audits **GitHub Actions CI/CD** for a repo — the router
that ties the other two plugins together, plus the ground they don't cover:

- **Jenkins → GHA conversion.** Reads a `Jenkinsfile` stage-by-stage and maps it
  to a GHA workflow (`agent`/`environment`/`withCredentials`/`parallel`/`post`/
  `when` → their GHA equivalents), flagging anything with no clean mapping
  (shared libraries, heavy Groovy) instead of guessing.
- **Greenfield interview.** No pipeline at all yet? It asks: what should it do,
  frontend or backend, Vercel or AWS, EC2 or ECS, does the ECR registry already
  exist.
- **Routes, doesn't reimplement.** Vercel target → hands off to
  `vercel-gha-deploy` entirely. Every target → always wires in
  `upliftcontrolversion`'s version-tag contract.
- **Owns AWS EC2 (docker-compose via SSM) and ECS (Fargate + ECR)** directly,
  with copy-paste templates for both.
- **Terraform-only for infra** — if a target needs AWS infrastructure that
  doesn't exist yet (like a fresh ECR repo), it says so and points at
  Terraform rather than provisioning anything itself.

Ask Claude to "set up GitHub Actions for this repo", "convert this Jenkinsfile
to GHA", "migrate off Jenkins", or "this repo has no CI yet" and it runs the
decision tree: detect state → runner choice (self-hosted vs GitHub-hosted) →
target-specific setup → version wiring → branch gate.

```
/plugin install upliftgha@uplift-plugins
```

## Install the marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add uplift-technology-company-limited/vercel-gha-deploy
/plugin install <plugin-name>@uplift-plugins
```

Skills activate automatically when relevant. You can also invoke one explicitly,
e.g. `/vercel-gha-deploy:vercel-gha-deploy` or
`/upliftcontrolversion:upliftcontrolversion`.
